=== Why is feature XYZ not supported? ===
In order to keep the code small and reduce maintenance costs we have limited the 
features available in our new texture tools. For this reason, we have also open sourced the code, so that people can modify it and add their own custom features.

=== Do the NVIDIA Texture Tools work on OSX? ===
It currently compiles and runs properly, but it has not been tested extensively.
In particular there may be endiannes errors on PowerPC systems.

=== Do the NVIDIA Texture Tools work on Linux? ===
Yes.

=== Do the NVIDIA Texture Tools work on Windows Vista? ===
Yes, but note that CUDA is not supported on Vista yet, so the tool is not hardware 
accellerated.

=== Is CUDA required? ===
No. The Visual Studio solution file contains a configuration that allows you
to compile the texture tools without CUDA support. The cmake scripts automatically
detect the CUDA installation and use it only when available.

=== Where can I get CUDA? ===
At [http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda.html]

=== Can I use the NVIDIA Texture Tools in my commercial application? ===
Yes, the NVIDIA Texture Tools are licensed under the MIT license.

=== Can I use the NVIDIA Texture Tools in my GPL application? ===
Yes, the MIT license is compatible with the GPL and LGPL licenses.
