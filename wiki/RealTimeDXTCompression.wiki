#summary Real-Time DXT Compression

The compressors available in the NVIDIA Texture Tools are not designed for real-time compression. If you need to compress textures in real-time, I'd recommend to look at the following sources:

J.M.P. van Waveren was the first one to describe a [http://www.intel.com/cd/ids/developer/asmo-na/eng/dc/index.htm real-time DXT compressor]. This compressor is part of the of [http://softwarecommunity.intel.com/UserFiles/en-us/Image/1221/Real-Time%20Texture%20Streaming%20&%20Decompression.pdf real-time texture streaming pipeline] used in some [http://www.idsoftware.com Id Software] games. He obtains the following results with his SSE2 optimized implementation:

|| *CPU* || *DXT1* || *DXT5* ||
|| Intel 2.8 GHz Dual Core Xeon || 112.05 MP/s || 66.43 MP/s ||
|| Intel 2.9 GHz Core 2 Extreme || 200.62 MP/s || 127.55 MP/s ||

The same algorithm described by Waveren can also be adapted easily to the GPU. This is what Simon Green did in [http://developer.download.nvidia.com/SDK/10/opengl/samples.html#compress_DXT this OpenGL SDK example]. The performance on the GPU is much more impressive:

|| *GPU* || *DXT1* || *DXT5* ||
|| geForce 8800 GTX || 1,547 MP/s || - ||
|| geForce 8600 GTS || 461 MP/s || - ||
