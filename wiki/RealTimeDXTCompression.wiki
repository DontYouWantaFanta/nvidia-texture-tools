#summary Real-Time DXT Compression

The compressors available in the NVIDIA Texture Tools are not designed for real-time compression. If you need to compress textures in real-time, I'd recommend to look at the following sources:

J.M.P. van Waveren was the first one to describe a [http://www.intel.com/cd/ids/developer/asmo-na/eng/dc/index.htm real-time DXT compressor]. This compressor is part of the of [http://softwarecommunity.intel.com/UserFiles/en-us/Image/1221/Real-Time%20Texture%20Streaming%20&%20Decompression.pdf real-time texture streaming pipeline] used in some [http://www.idsoftware.com Id Software] games.

The same algorithm described there can also be adapted easily to the GPU. This is what Simon Green did in [http://developer.download.nvidia.com/SDK/10/opengl/samples.html#compress_DXT this OpenGL SDK example].

If you need higher quality, it's possible to use DXT5-YCoCg. More info coming soon.

However, if you cannot afford duplicating the memory consumption, you can try using a higher quality compressor.

ryg from [http://www.farbrausch.de Farbrausch] provides some code to do [https://mollyrocket.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=392&start=0&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight= load time DXT compression] of procedural textures, as done in [http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=30244 this demo].
