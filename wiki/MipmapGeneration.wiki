== Conclusions ==

Here are some misc findings:

  * Filters with radius greater than 3 produce too much ringing artifacts.
  * For good results with non power of two textures or arbitrary scales, you must use polyphase filters.
  * Sampling the polyphase filter with a box filter greatly improves the quality.
  * Using a triangle filter looks even better, but the difference is small.
  * For most cases box does a great job.
  * Lanczos and Kaiser produce indistinguishable results.
  * Gamma correction produces more correct results, but enhances the ringing artifacts.
