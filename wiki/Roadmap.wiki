#summary NVIDIA Texture Tools Roadmap

Here's a rough roadmap for the next releases of the NVIDIA Texture Tools:

= 2.1 =

Completed features:
 * ~~Support for linear color transforms and swizzles: [http://code.google.com/p/nvidia-texture-tools/issues/detail?id=4 Issue 4]~~
 * ~~Higher quality DXT3 compressor: [http://code.google.com/p/nvidia-texture-tools/issues/detail?id=38 Issue 38]~~
 * ~~Migration to CUDA 2.0: [http://code.google.com/p/nvidia-texture-tools/issues/detail?id=46 Issue 46]~~
 * ~~Support for alpha premultiplication. [http://code.google.com/p/nvidia-texture-tools/issues/detail?id=30 Issue 30]~~
